## Problem

Whenever we start a new project, we spend a lot of time looking for inspiration on hundreds of websites, we take a little of each, and so we build our beloved Frankenstein ü§ñ. Our most important references are the most well-known Startups (Airbnb, Medium, Product Hunt, etc) as they have invested a lot of time in analyzing the best practices of design, validation of ideas, calls to action, hook, etc. And over time have been creating standards and trends.

<br>

## Solution

Since many are looking for these sites, we decided to create a skeleton of HTML styles and components based on these big companies, themes that are 100% editable and adaptable to your own palette color or styles, adding your own magic üîÆ!. So that your product remains authentic and unique.

**With this, we do not seek to copy the big companies, but to obtain inspiration and have its base for our own projects.**

The themes include the basic elements in a website: buttons, labels, links, typography, form elements, box components, search bar, navbars, etc, etc, etc.

Contributions are more than welcome.

## Base methodology

For our own components, follow the BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) method for writing & organising CSS. BEM helps keep our CSS logical and predictable. The naming convention follows this pattern:

```css
.block {}
.block__element {}
.block__element--modifier {}
```

- ```.block``` represents the higher level of an abstraction or component.

- ```.block__element``` represents a descendent of .block that helps form .block as a whole.

- ```.block--modifier``` represents a different state or version of .block.

## Installation and use

<h3 align="center">
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergioruizdavila/startups-themes/develop/www/assets/images/compare%20themes.png" alt="compare">
</h3>

<br>

### Install

Really you don¬¥t need an **'installation'**, you just could clone the project, take the 'theme' folder and you are able to start. The only tools that you need to use these themes are:

- **Sass**
- **Boostrap v3.3.7** *(to keep row and column structure, but you can feel free to use another library for that, the only issue is that you could see the components examples in index HTML a little bit wrong, because we use bootstrap to arrange each component inside row and column grids).*

<br>

#### If you want to run the demo page, you should follow this steps:

**1:** Install NodeJS v6 or latest (Not sure if there is any problem with previous versions, but this is the one we use).

**2:** On terminal (inside root directory) run the following commands:

1. Clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/sergioruizdavila/startups-themes.git projectname
```

2. Install gulp, bower and express components:
```shell
npm install
```

3. Install basic components such as boostrap, jquery, animate.css:
```shell
bower install
```
4. Launch a local server in order to see styles guideline:
```shell
gulp start
```

**3:** Open your favorite browser, and browse to:

**http://localhost:8080/**

There you can see whole styles guidelinein in a demo page.

<br>


### How to use?

It's very simple, you have to copy the **theme** folder into your own project, inside you will find all styles organized by **components**, and a folder named **core** which contains all global styles and variables (e.g. main palette, helper classes, font family, etc.).

<h3 align="center">
	<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/sergioruizdavila/startups-themes/56d23613/www/assets/images/structure_files.png" alt="structure files">
</h3>

**The file structure is:**

- ***components:*** A folder containing all styles of each component (buttons, links, forms, paragraphs, inputs, etc.)

- ***core:*** Here are all the base styles of your project, here you find a file named **_global.scss** which contains all the global variables, helper classes, and base classes to reset the styles of some global elements such as the body, H tags, labels, etc.

- ***app.scss:*** This is the parent file which contains a reference to all other styles:

<h3 align="center">
	<img src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/sergioruizdavila/startups-themes/d6b7a6e5/www/assets/images/app_file.png" alt="app file">
</h3>

- **app.min.css:** It's the final result after running a small task in Gulp, compile it, concatenates and minifies every style in a single file. This is the file you should add in the **< head >** html section.

```html
<! your vendors >
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/build/css/vendor.min.css">

<! theme styles >
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/theme/app.css">
```
- **app.css**: If you don't use Sass or another preprocessor, don't worry you can take this file and include it into your own project, and you could use any of the components freely.

<br>

You can also see examples of all components on **index.html**. You will see all the components organized by groups, you can simply take the component you need, and take it to your own project.

**Important:** Themes are not a copy, we write styles and structure from scratch, based on our own file structure and our own way of organizing styles (based n the [BEM methodology](https://en.bem.info/)), what we want with this is to create a 'skeleton' that can be used, edited, modified and replaced in any project.
